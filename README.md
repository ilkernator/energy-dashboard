# energy-dashboard
A Streamlit App to monitor electricity and gas consumption
This code crawles personal data from two different energy providers, 'Naturstrom' and 'Lichtblick'.
Obviously other pages can be referenced as well. In order to run the code locally, one needs
to add the respective login credentials for the web crawler to authenticate.
In this case, the following env variables need to be set:

```
naturstrom_login_user
naturstrom_login_pw
lichtblick_login_user
lichtblick_login_pw
``````
